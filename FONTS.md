"Anonymous Pro (2009) is a family of four fixed-width fonts designed with coding in mind. Anonymous Pro features an international, Unicode-based character set, with support for most Western and Central European Latin-based languages, plus Greek and Cyrillic.

## Consolamono
"It's my old unfinished font. I made some sketches of several glyphs 5-6 years ago, and I never finished this. Now I made missing glyphs, did changes of some glyphs and turn into monospaced font. The font is updated now (2011.06.17) - I made all glyphs for Latin Extended B, Cyrillic, and Cyrillic Supplement. Added Bold version 2012.11.16 2013.01.27"

## Cutive Mono
"The design of Cutive, and this monospace sister family Cutive Mono, is based on a number of classic typewriter typefaces, in particular the faces of IBM's 'Executive,' and the older 'Smith-Premier.' In Cutive these old faces re-emerge as webfonts that are useful for adding character to body texts as well as in larger sizes for headers and display."

## Fifteen
"Fifteen is a faux bitmap font. This font is designed to be used as a monotype font for use in a terminal, or at a larger size, to look like an over scaled bitmap. It is designed for 15 pixel use. It is as narrow as I could make it, and works well in a 132 column terminal window. It is, of course, monospaced and has clearly distinct 1I and l, and the zero is slashed. Character set is limited in this first release to ascii + smart quotes."

## GNU Unifont
"This version provides full coverage of the Unicode 7.0 Basic Mulitlingual Plane (BMP). The BMP is the first Unicode "plane" of 65,536 code points, and has character encoding for most of the world's modern scripts.  
As of 20 June 2008 (by coincidence the Summer Solstice), GNU Unifont had a glyph for every printable code point in the Unicode BMP. That version covered Unicode 5.1, which was the current version at the time. Roman Czyborra began this effort in 1998, with earlier efforts starting around 1994. The 2008 release was thus the culmination of a more than ten-year effort."

## Hermit

## Inconsolata
"Inconsolata is my first serious original font release. It is a monospace font, designed for printed code listings and the like. There are a great many "programmer fonts," designed primarily for use on the screen, but in most cases do not have the attention to detail for high resolution rendering.  
Inconsolata draws from many inspirations and sources. I was particularly struck by the beauty of Luc(as) de Groot's Consolas, which is his monospaced design for Microsoft's Vista release. This font, similar to his earlier TheSansMono, demonstrated clearly to me that monospaced fonts do not have to suck."

## Inconsolata-g
"I use the free Inconsolata font (by Raph Levien) to program and as shell font, and I like it a lot. I have seen this blog post: "Adding straight single and double quotes to Inconsolata", that offers Inconsolata-dz:
So I've uses FontForge to modify more his Inconsolata version, to fix some of the things I don't like of Inconsolata."

The Liberation fonts are intended as free, open-source replacements of the aforementioned commercial fonts."

## Nova Mono
"I created the NovaCut font about 14-15 years ago for making inscriptions on stone. Initially the font contained only capitals and digits and existed only on paper and stone inscriptions. In 2010 I decided transfer this font to a computer, and made the missing lowercase and some basical signs; it was initially named Gothica."
