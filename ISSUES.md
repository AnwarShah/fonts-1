## Known issues and disclaimer

Sometimes, switching fonts causes the cursor and selection to misalign. Not with all fonts, not all the time. This issue is tracked here: https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/3201 (although it doesn't seem limited to the Hermit font). Switching to a default font (e.g. Menlo), or relaunching seem to solve this for most fonts most of the time. Beta software...

I've tried to check everything re: licenses and have not included fonts where I think the license does not allow it. If any font is included but shouldn't be, let me know and I'll take it out.

I cannot vouch for the completeness or correctness of included fonts.

You should be able to use the font names listed here to do further tweaking in your stylesheets (e.g. use a different font for Markdown), but that's not tested at this point
